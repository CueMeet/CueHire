# Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up CueHired on your local machine for development. There are two ways to install and run CueHired:

1. [Docker Installation](./docker-installation) - Recommended for most users as it provides an isolated environment with all dependencies pre-configured.
2. [Direct Installation](./direct-installation) - For users who prefer to run services directly on their machine.
